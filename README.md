# Motivation to learn Go
Go's readily availble concurrency primitves is what had intrigued me in the first place. Unlike other languages spinning up a new thread in Go is as easy as firing a **go func()**. This  got me hooked instantly and here I am trying to explore this really nifty and nimble language. Besides Go shines in the world of microservices which is a big plus for me. With Ken Thompson as one of it's founding fathers, GoLang definitely deserves to be explored by everyone.
